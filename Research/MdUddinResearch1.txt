Md Uddin – Research Summary
Topic: Marriott Hotels in Singapore and Competitors

Marriott in Singapore:
Marriott has hotels like JW Marriott South Beach, Tang Plaza, and The St. Regis. Most use mobile check-in, but don’t offer advanced AI features.

Hilton and Accor Comparison:
Hilton uses a robot concierge (Connie), chat support, and smart room controls.
Accor uses AI for pricing, room settings, and voice automation in some hotels.

Conclusion:
Marriott lags behind in AI. It should add voice assistants, kiosks, and service bots.
